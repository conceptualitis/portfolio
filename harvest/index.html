                A few months ago I got interested in remote work. I'm something of a habitual mover, so having a stable job without a geographical dependencey would change my life. I've also spent a lot of time under flourescent lights in windowless offices and I just don't think that's my ideal work environment. Not to mention the stress of commuting. This got me browsing the We Work Remotely jobs board on a regular basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, why Harvest? Right now I'm helping a small web development shop run their projects. We handle time-tracking by letting the developers run their own timers (something like <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>) and reporting hours. Then I invoice with <a href="http://freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks</a>. It's pretty easy to see the utility Harvest provides. <em>(I also knew you guys through my husband who is a front-end developer at Match.com &mdash; he says, "great work on Chosen!")</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                I actually saw one of your earlier postings for Harvest Expert and started applying. Here's some proof:
            </p>


            <blockquote class="scrollable">
                <h2>
                    My best customer service experience.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a few items that are incredibly hard to buy, primarily for the effort that goes into shopping for them. Mattresses and cars are pretty hard, sure, but it seems that strollers are the most difficult thing to buy. You'll have guilt colliding with a desire for frugality all mingling with wanting to provide the best for your kid. Which is what makes the pleasant experience we had buying ours so exceptional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we walked into the store that day our objective was to try out the two brands of stroller we'd discovered during our research. Upon inspection, each of them had glaring practicality issues &mdash; one being unstable and the other was far too heavy to lift regularly (it could, however, assemble itself &mdash; for real, <a href="http://www.4moms.com/origami">check it out if you want</a>.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Routed by this turn of events we considered leaving the store when Holly approached us. She started by having us try out a number of different strollers we hadn't previously considered &mdash; we pushed them around, adding/removing attachments to make it as close to the perfect stroller we didn't know we could have. After figuring out the configuration we wanted, Holly sat us down to discuss color schemes, providing suggestions when we got stuck. She recommended color schemes and materials that were the most durable &mdash; her expertise with the products was evident. Holly, as it turned out, was a former Beverly Hills nanny which is like having the purple heart of stroller selection. Settling on a sand and black theme, she let us know that the attachments could also be customized. She even threw in the cup holder for free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I were to break it down I'd say there were three key components to this being a great experience.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Getting something for free, which establishes trust. I'd expect these things to be items which sweeten the deal but don't account for much of the total sale.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Patience was a huge factor. Without her taking over an hour to walk us through all the various options there was no way we would've found our stroller and certainly no way we'd buy at that store.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How much she knew and how much she was willing to demonstrate. You'll assemble the stroller for us and show us how to collapse it and reconfigure it? Great!
                    </li>
                </ol>

                I never submitted that application because I started to realize that most remote work would be for web companies and that I knew very little about how the web is actually made. So I reached out, got some help, and started learning how to make a website.

                As it turns out, this stuff is <strong>hard</strong>.

            <p>
                I tumbled down the rabbit hole of learning to use so many tools. Jekyll, Git, and GitHub run this particular site. I can definitely say I've gained a new appreciation for the time it takes to craft something meaningful. I'm also a little hooked on the taste of power. Before, I'd used WordPress and Blogger but this is different &mdash; with all the difficulty comes an unprecendeted level of control and independence.

                My work experience has traditionally involved working with many people and mitigating the concerns of those less than flexible in both the public and private sectors, from medical to education to the internet. I've become competent at massaging out the wrinkles and bringing everyone around to a happy place.
