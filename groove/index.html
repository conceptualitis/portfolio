                A few months ago I got interested in remote work. I'm something of a habitual mover, so having a stable job without a geographical dependency would change my life. I've also spent a lot of time under fluorescent lights in windowless offices and I just don't think that's my ideal work environment. Not to mention the stress of commuting. This got me browsing the We Work Remotely jobs board on a regular basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early on, I started to realize that most remote work would be for web companies and that I knew very little about how the web is actually made. So I reached out, got some help, and started learning how to make a website.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it turns out, this stuff is <strong>hard</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tumbled down the rabbit hole of learning to use so many tools. Jekyll, Git, and GitHub run this particular site. I can definitely say I've gained a new appreciation for the time it takes to craft something meaningful. I'm also a little hooked on the taste of power. Before, I'd used WordPress and Blogger but this is different &mdash; with all the difficulty comes an unprecedented level of control and independence.

            <h2>
                So, why Groove?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Right now I'm helping a small web development shop run their projects. We handle customer support through individual email. Someone receives an email and then either replies or forwards the query to another team member. When trying to decipher communication during a co-worker's absence, it's pretty easy to see the utility Groove provides. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                A little (more) about me.
            </h2>
            <p>
                My work experience has traditionally involved working with many people and mitigating the concerns of those less than flexible in both the public and private sectors, from medical to education to the internet. I've become competent at massaging out the wrinkles and bringing everyone around to a happy place. If you'd like more details about my work experiences, they can be found on <a href="/assets/pdf/resume.pdf">my resume</a>.

            <h2>
                Just call my name and I'll be there. 
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'd love to chat more about you, your product, and maybe even a little more about me.
