            <p>Hi there, Stitch Star!</p>

            <p>
              How are things going? I was looking at your recent stats and noticed that you've been struggling with your Fix goals and keep rates. You've always met (and exceeded!) your goals so I wanted to reach out today and offer support in bring those numbers back up. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Going through some of your recent Fixes, I saw a trend to fewer accessories included than you've previously sent - those categories are such a great way to bring down a boxes total cost for price-conscious clients and increase your keep rate! 
            </p>


            <p>
              With the shift to cooler weather everywhere, it can be difficult to decide on appropriate sweaters and jackets, thereby reducing FPH. In the instances you find yourself at an impasse, trust the algorithm to narrow down your choices, and then trust your initial instinct! You've been delighting your clients for some months, you've got this!
            </p>

            <p>
              Of course, if there are challenging circumstances that aren't necessarily related to the above suggestions, please let me know so we can work together to find at least a temporary resolution. 
            </p>

            <p>
              You're an amazing stylist and your feedback shows that your clients feel the same. Let me know what you think!
            </p>

            <p>
              Cheers,
