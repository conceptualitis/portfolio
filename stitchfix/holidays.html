            <p>Happy Monday, Star Stylers!</p>

            <p>
              The holiday spirit is in the air and I, for one, can't wait for all the festivities to
              officially begin! Now if only all the gifts would buy, wrap and prep themselves&hellip;
            </p>

            <p>
              Before the eggnog starts flowing, I wanted to send some encouragement &amp; tips to my
              amazing team as we still have hours and goals to meet in the meantime! I'll keep this
              (fairly!) short &amp; sweet since I know how busy this time of year can be for all of you.
              Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions on topics I didn't address &mdash; I'm
              here to help in any way I can!
            </p>
            
            <h3>Carving out personal time:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The holidays can be stressful, even without work hours to meet! If you find yourself struggling
              to fit in big blocks of styling time, break them up into more manageable increments. Style for an
              hour, take a hot chocolate break for an hour, and so on!</li>
              <li>I firmly believe in feeling your personal best to make your clients feel their best. Get
              dressed even if you're working from your living room that day! Bonus: spontaneous trips out
              are so much more enjoyable when you're already dressed and ready!</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Meeting hours:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Set a timer! It's hard to gauge exactly how long you've spent on a particular client. Try
              setting a timer if you're finding yourself scrolling and scrolling and scrolling&hellip; You'll find
              your pace in no time!</li>
              <li>Front load your week with more hours completed before Wednesday as weekend and Friday holiday
              events become more and more common. I've struggled with this myself, but am so glad when I do! </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Get inspired:</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Feel like you're in a styling rut? I highly recommend all of you check out the 
              <a href="http://www.sfstylelounge.com">Style Lounge</a> for note and style inspiration, if you haven't already! Personally, I have the Stylist Note Manual bookmarked for easy referencing when I feel like I'm out of things to say!</li>
              <li>Also, any questions you may have about taking holiday vacation time and sick leave can be answered there as well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Let's connect:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>I know it can feel somewhat isolating as we all work toward keeping ourselves motivated and on task, so let's do that together! I'll be styling at Top Pot Donuts tomorrow if anyone would like company (I always do!). I'll update our Yammer page on my favorite places to style, and would love to hear yours as well! A team who styles together, stays together!</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You've all been amazing at delighting our clients - let's keep that momentum going!</p>

            <p>
              Cheers, 
              <br>
