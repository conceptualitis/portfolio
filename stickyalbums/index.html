                About a year ago I got interested in remote work. I'm something of a habitual mover, so having a stable job without a geographical dependency would change my life. I've also spent a lot of time under fluorescent lights in windowless offices and I just don't think that's my ideal work environment. Not to mention the stress of commuting. This got me browsing the We Work Remotely jobs board on a regular basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early on, I started to realize that most remote work would be for web companies and that I knew very little about how the web is actually made. So I reached out, got some help, and started learning how to make a website.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it turns out, this stuff is <strong>hard</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tumbled down the rabbit hole of learning to use so many tools. Jekyll, Git, and GitHub run this particular site. I can definitely say I've gained a new appreciation for the time it takes to craft something meaningful. I'm also a little hooked on the taste of power. Before, I'd used WordPress and Blogger but this is different &mdash; with all the difficulty comes an unprecedented level of control and independence.
            </p>
            <h2>
                So, why StickyAlbums?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Right now I'm helping a small web development shop run their projects. We handle customer support through individual email, which is also my favorite part of my job. When a client reaches out to support, it’s because they’re not able to reach their goals through the  service. It’s my responsibility to get them out of that unproductive place and back into their work groove. The StickyAlbums site boasts transparency of the service, which in turn shows that the service truly cares about their clients. This is something I can feel confident I could contribute to. 
            <p>

                I've also been interested in photography for a number of years and have had the privilege of working with a handful of photographers, usually as a client. Through these experiences, I've gone through many preview processes &mdash; some more cumbersome than others &mdash; and it's clear to see the utility StickyAlbums provides.

            <h2>
                A little (more) about me.
            </h2>
            <p>
                My work experience has traditionally involved working with many people and mitigating the concerns of those less than flexible in both the public and private sectors, from medical to education to the internet. I've become competent at massaging out the wrinkles and bringing everyone around to a happy place. If you'd like more details about my work experiences, they can be found on <a href="/assets/pdf/resume.pdf">my resume</a>.

            <h2>
                Just call my name and I'll be there. 
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'd love to chat more about you, your product, and maybe even a little more about me.
